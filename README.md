# Swift-Capture-List
Learning about how to capture list in Swift

# Capture List
// There are 3 types - strong, weak, and unowned
// capture values
// To avoid strong reference cycles


# Strong Capturing - values inside closure will never get destroyed

# Weak Capturing
// Unlike strong, the values inside is destroyed and set to nil
// the return value is always optional either contain a value or they don't

# unowned capturing
// its like implicitly unwrapping optional and need to be used carefully as they return nil
//
